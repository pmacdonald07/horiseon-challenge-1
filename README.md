Refactoring Horiseon Homepage

The goal of this project was to gain experience refactoring a web page for better accessibility and more streamlined code.

To complete these goals I did the following:
    Added html semantic elements for better accessibility. This included adding header, nav, footer, section, article, and aside elements.
    Introduced a concise title the the webpage.
    Added alt attributes to images and icons.
    Consolidated CSS style sheet. There were several repetitive style elements that were combined for more efficiency using more economical class and element selectors.
    Made sure internal links were operating properly.
    Addressed a potential bug that keeps the VoiceOver screen reader from properly reading unordered list elements in the navigation bar.

By completing this project I learned a great deal about making a website accessible and its html and css code efficient.

This final webpage can be viewed at:
